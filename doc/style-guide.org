** Functions
- When looking for a function for a special purpose, read the "best-practice.org". For example, when intents to create a keyword symbol, use the function MAKE-KEYWORD provided by package ELOQUENT.MVC.PRELUDE, because this function will convert the source string to its upper-case.
** Naming Conventions
*** Class Name
- Classes' name should be surrounded by '<' and '>'. For example, the type represents a HTTP request in Eloquent-MVC is defined of name "<http-request>".
*** Function Name
- In most cases, a function's name should be a combination of a verb followed by a noun.
*** Method Name
- Readers, writters and accessors' name should be form <slot-name>-of.
